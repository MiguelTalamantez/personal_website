                For my capstone mechanical engineering class, I led a team of 10 students to
                design an innovative 100mL small-scale lab bench bioreactor that bridges
                the gap between what’s in demand for bioreactors and what’s currently
                available on the market.

                My role on the team was team lead, as well as a member of the Sensors and
                Electronics Control System (SECS) subteam. I organized work, files, and
                helped keep the project on track.

                For my power electronics class, I designed and built a custom theremin meant
                to highlight key power electronics concepts such as Half and full H-bridges,
                frequency modulation, and boost converters. The project took approximately
                a month to design and build and was a lot of fun!

                For my Microcomputer Laboratory class, I made a digitized theremin for 
                my final project. Over a month, I designed a built this project to showcase 
                my gained knowledge in microcomputer systems using a PSoC and signal 
                processing circuitry. Using my hand and an antenna, I am able to change 
                the frequency of an oscillator circuit which then is read by a PSoC 5LP. T
                he PSoC produces a corresponding audible frequency into a speaker to allow 
                for an instrument that makes sound without being touched.

                In a team of 5, I designed and implemented a custom PokemonGO-inspired 
                game using an ESP32, Google APIs, SQL Databases, and Wifi-location tracking. 
                Project had a TFT display, motion sensing used to "throw" game objects, 
                and a real-time satellite map view of user location. All code used in the 
                project can be found on my github page.

                2.007 is MIT's fundamental design and manufacturing class. 
                Here, I learned how to use SolidWorks, how to prototype, 
                and how to machine. This robot was my first design experience 
                and allowed me to explore my interest in design. Although my 
                robot base was quite simple, I focused a lot on my most critical 
                module (MCM) which was a spring-loaded ratchet. This allowed my 
                robot to not only use the torque of its motor to spin a bar, 
                but use 2.5 times the amount of force as the motor using a ratchet system.

                My first real project with batteries and designing a battery pack in 
                small scale. Working with my mentor Dan Levine, I designed and 
                manufactured test housings for a custom battery pack for the lab’s 
                most recent prosthetic leg. The goal was to make a custom battery 
                pack that was as compact as possible while still being safe, reliable, 
                and with long battery capacity.

                Over the Summer of 2023, I was a UROP at the Biomimetics lab doing firmware 
                and hardware-related work for the lab. Using STM32, I wrote firmware for a 
                powerboard that takes data from a few sensors and transmits it to other 
                boards and systems via CAN bus. There was a little existing code in mbed, 
                so my work was moving it to STM32cubeide and adding some things along the way.

                During the semester, I worked on battery research doing EIS (electrochemical 
                impedance spectroscopy) on cylindrical cells using a custom-made battery cell 
                tester I helped assembly. This system used a raspberry Pi to control an 
                oscilliscope, a bipolar power supply, a custom cooling system, and contacts 
                to the battery cell.

                MakeMIT (MIT’s biggest hackathon) 2022 was held at MIT campus and I 
                participated with several friends of mine. Our project was called the 
                Rail Snail and aimed to help people in wheelchairs since the theme of 
                that competition was aimed at mobility. Our project used a few motors, 
                a battery, and an Arduino nano to pull wheelchair users up ramps. 
                We realized going up ramps on campus is a very annoying process and 
                takes a lot of work, so we wanted to help with that process by making 
                a device to do the work for you.

                In my second year of doing MakeMIT, a few more friends of 
                mine and I competed and designed a device once again for 
                wheelchair users. This year's topic was recovery, and it 
                was perfectly timed for my team. My friend Faris just happened 
                to break his leg a week or two earlier and was in a wheelchair 
                recovering from his injury. Inspired by wanting to make his 
                situation better, we redesigned his wheelchair to be more ergonomic 
                and easier to use. Wheelchair users often talk about how difficult 
                it is to move around and how non-ergonomic wheelchairs are, so we 
                focused on making wheelchairs easier to use and feel more natural. 
                Our ending design ended up looking something similar to treadmill 
                handles re-engineered onto a wheelchair. The idea was that pushing 
                handles forward utilizes muscles that are better for long-term force 
                and movement as opposed to rotating wheels to move.

                I joined the EVT my sophomore year because of my interest 
                in battery engineering and the mission that the team was 
                setting out to tackle which was pushing the frontier of 
                Hydrogen innovation. I served as the team's battery lead 
                and helped design, manufacture, and implement a custom 
                battery pack for the bike. This was a significant engineering 
                experience for as it allowed me to apply the knowledge I 
                had learned in class to something very real. Further documentation 
                is located on the EVT website.

                In my Instrumentation and Measurement class, I conducted a research project meant 
                to test the relationship between speed and battery drain on an electric motorcycle. 
                I used a Hydrogen-Electric hybrid motorcycle to conduct this experiment and presented 
                my work at the end of the semester with a poster and a paper.
